    		<h3> Best for Hands-on Activities</h3>

			<h4>Ms. Cassidy’s Classroom Blog</h4>
				<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Canadian first-grade teacher Kathy Cassidy invites readers into the classroom to interact with students and her dynamic lessons.
				<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Besides sharing fun ideas like making fairy-tale characters out of clay, Cassidy lets us witness her students’ learning firsthand by posting lots of videos and photographs. And another bonus: We get to learn from Cassidy’s many guest speakers, too!
				<br><strong>Why She Loves Blogging:</strong> “My favorite thing about blogging,” says Cassidy, “is that the students literally have a worldwide audience. They see themselves as writers because people can and do read and comment on their work.”</p>

    		<h3> Best News From the Trenches</h3>
    			<h4>Teach for Us</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Teach for America teachers share the ins and outs of the sometimes controversial program.
					<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Whether you want TFA dirt (like how tough the boot-camp training really is) or warm fuzzies (like one blogger’s quest to get her student to love books by reading with her nightly over the phone), you’ll find the goods in this collection of blogs from TFA corps members working all over the country.</p>

    		<h3> Best for Art Teachers (or Other Happy Finger-Painters!)</h3>
    			<h4>The Teaching Palette</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Teachers Hillary Andrlik and Theresa McGee cover useful resources (like the best iPhone apps for art teachers), classroom-management techniques, and art-worthy news.
					<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> With arts programs always under threat, it’s nice to feel like there’s an online home for people who value the importance of watercolor and oil paints.
					<br><strong>Why They Love Blogging:</strong> Both McGee and Andrlik enjoy the opportunity to connect with teachers nationally and internationally. Says McGee, “Art education has a unique set of challenges, and blogging has created an online forum to share ideas.” Adds Andrlik, “Our readers often give us new insight on a topic or provide a fresh perspective based on their unique experience.”</p>

    		<h3>Best for Super Science Ideas</h3>
    			<h4>ScienceFix</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Middle school science teacher Darren Fix entertains with science lessons and experiments.
						Why We Love It: Watch his Mr. Wizard-style experiments, like using a jellyfish to learn genetic engineering.
						<br><strong>Why He Loves Blogging:</strong> Says Fix, “Posting stimulates my creativity and leads to new ideas. It’s a positive experience in a profession that unfortunately dwells on the negative too much.”</p>

    		<h3> Best Superintendent Straight Talk</h3>
    			<h4>The Principals Page</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Illinois superintendent Michael Smith chronicles his day to day.
						<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Smith’s blog discusses everything from Ferris Bueller to teaching conferences to a surefire way for President Obama to fix education.
						<br><strong>Why He Loves Blogging:</strong> Says Smith, “It allows a small-town superintendent to be involved in national or worldwide discussions on education issues.”</p>

    		<h3> Best for Kid Book Reviews</h3>
    			<h4>A Year of Reading</h4> 
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Teachers Franki Sibberson and Mary Lee Hahn review new children’s books.
						<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> The reviews are always teacher-focused, pinpointing possible readers as well as how a book might be used in the classroom.
						<br><strong>Why They Love Blogging:</strong> Says Sibberson, “The writing helps us stay current on books and with teaching.”</p>

    		<h3>Best Student-Written Blog</h3>
				<h4>Youth Voices</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Students and their teachers participate in a “colossal ongoing discussion about everything” via podcasts, 	videos, and blogs.
					  <br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> This blog turns the typical student-teacher relationship on its head with both parties acting as equals and learning from each other.</p>

    		<h3> Best Laugh-Out-Loud Blog</h3>
				<h4>Regurgitated Alpha Bits</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> An anonymous elementary school teacher blogs about the students she loves and the job
					    she hates.
						<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> This blog gives you totally true antics of the elementary school kind and tips you can really use: Preview “educational” videos before showing and be alert for fourth-grade make-out sessions! Perfect with a good cup of coffee, when you need to block out irritating colleagues, and when you could use a good laugh to start your day.

   			<h3>Best Substitute Secrets</h3>
   				<h4>Just a Substitute Teacher</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> “Mr. Homework” tells harrowing tales of substitute life.
						<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Let’s be honest. Sometimes we’d rather come in sick than call in a sub. Mr. Homework, however, is one of the good guys. His outlook on the sub life (e.g., “Sometimes it’s not about actually teaching anything”) makes us wish he was in our district.</p>

    		<h3>Most Entertaining Math Blog</h3>
				<h4>Hooda Math Blog</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Math teacher and Hoodamath.com creator Michael Edlavitch uses games to teach math.
						<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> The word games may conjure images of worksheets with cutesy pics and fill-ins, but Edlavitch goes way beyond that. His arcade games with Flash — complete with worksheets teachers can print out — are reminiscent of old favorites like Pac-Man. Check out Edlavitch's new blog for his games and how they align with Common Core State Standards.</p>

    		<h3>Best Classroom Use of Blogs</h3>
				<h4>Learning Is Messy</h4>
					<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Brian Crosby discusses how he uses blogging and other technology in the classroom.
						<br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Crosby’s creativity can’t help but draw us in. He has used Skype to broadcast a class visit from Christa McAuliffe’s mother and to communicate with a student who is on home instruction due to leukemia.
						<br><strong>Why He Loves Blogging:</strong> Says Crosby, “It is the strongest resource I have experienced in 28 years of teaching.”</p>

				<h4>The Jose Vilson</h4>
       				<p><strong>The Lowdown:</strong> Artist, poet, and math educator Jose Vilson gives the inner city a human face by
       				  blogging about sometimes 	touchy topics.
					  <br><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> Vilson does not shy away from tackling the controversial, such as his entry about the shortage of black Latino male teachers like himself. He’s passionate about changing education and exposing inner-city reality, and his passion is contagious.</p>
